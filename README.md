Get the most most popular articles in NY-Times 

* It's a simple app bult with the React Framework to get the NY Times Most Popular Articles  and show a list of articles,
This app deal in CLIENT side only.
So I created the App using create-react-app command, and I create three components: 
    ` Default component <App /> , which is my container component`
    1. Article component <Article /> , this is a stateful comonent which contain my core state.
    2. Article component <ArticleList  /> , which is a UI component `stateless`.
    3. Navbar componet <Navbar />, also a stateless component.
    and I fetch the data using NY-Time API.
* Style: I used a pure CSS, and make it as much as mobile responsoble.
* Time: It takes about four hours.
